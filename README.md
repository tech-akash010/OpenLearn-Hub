### Import Path Aliases

The project uses TypeScript path aliases for cleaner imports:

```typescript
// Instead of: import { User } from '../../../types'
import { User } from '@/types';

// Instead of: import { Layout } from '../../components/layout/Layout'
import { Layout } from '@/components/layout/Layout';

// Instead of: import { authService } from '../../../services/auth/authService'
import { authService } from '@/services/auth/authService';
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Cleaner, more readable imports
- ✅ Easier refactoring (no path updates needed)
- ✅ Better IDE autocomplete
- ✅ Consistent import style across the codebase
