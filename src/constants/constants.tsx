    body: `## Core Scheduling Strategies\n\n### 1. FCFS (First Come First Served)\nThe simplest non-preemptive algorithm. While fair in order, it often leads to the "convoy effect" where short processes wait behind long ones.\n\n### 2. SJF (Shortest Job First)\nOptimal for minimizing average wait time. However, it requires knowing CPU burst times in advance, which is rarely possible.\n\n### 3. Round Robin (RR)\nThe standard for time-sharing systems. It uses a fixed "Time Quantum" to ensure no process starves.`,
